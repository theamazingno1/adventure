  <h1>You raise your hands and surrender to the sentient sock puppets</h1>

   <p>After wisely surrendering yourself to the dirty armed sentient sock puppets, the lights come on, revealing a monster so terrifying you find yourself frozen with fear. The monster then begins to speak. Where are you going? the monster asks in a soft-spoken tone. You look down for some sort of answer from the sentient sock puppets, but you realize they have lost all sentience and are now just a pile of dirty socks. You look back up and finally Muster up the courage to speak.</p>
