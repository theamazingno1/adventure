  <h1>Hell, you reply to the monster</h1>

   <p>You're finally understanding, the teriffying monster replies. Now the games stop.In what seems like an instant, the monster swallows you whole. Wondering what you have done to deserve such a cruel fate, you close your eyes and expect the worst. You are slowly chewed alive. You feel every stab and grind of the monsters teeth chewing into your flesh. Your memory starts to fade as tears rush down your face. You try to scream but nothing escapes. Your vocal cords were severed long ago. Feeling helpless, whilst also unable to move your body, all you can do is cry internally. After ages of torment your memory has completely faded. Still crying, you open your eyes. Giant masked figures surround you while all cheering. They start to clean you after cutting the chord attached to your bellybutton. Having no memory of what happened you keep crying until you fall asleep. The next memory you have is of you running down an alley being chased by three vicious dogs. You run, run, and run until you can't run anymore. Somehow you have escaped the dogs. Exhausted, you keep your head down as you look at the puddle of water on the floor. You are a cat. Out of breath and unable to sweat you need a way to cool down as soon as possible. Will you drink from the puddle? .</p>
